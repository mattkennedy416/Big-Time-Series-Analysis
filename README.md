A collection of open source packages and universal interface focused on time series clustering and anomaly detection in univariate and multivariate data.

Algorithms are planned to be applicable to "big data" where models are only capable of observing a small subset 
, and results can be extrapolated to analyze streaming data for recognizing patterns, classifying segments, and identifying unexpected patterns in a unsupervised manner. 

Many of these third party packages are entirely written in Python, where porting to Numba, C, or CUDA may provide immense speed-ups.
